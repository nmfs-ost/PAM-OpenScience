    "text": "Open Science is a movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, software) transparent and accessible so that knowledge is shared. This repository provides resources to help NOAA Fisheries Passive Acoustic Monitoring groups adopt an Open Science approach to their research.\nPublic access to knowledge is a fundamental component of Open Science that often takes a back seat to open access to methods and data. The open sharing of knowledge not only helps our future selves, it also helps serves to lessen the inequities inherent in scientific research. When we learn something new, we should consider how we can share this information. Here we give advice on sharing knowledge through BioAcoustics Stack Exchange (a public Q & A platform) and with Zotero Libraries (shared public libraries to identify reports and publications).\nCo-working allows researchers to work together in time and/or space to provide motivation, accountability, and assistance. There are any number of ways to co-work, and here we provide a few suggestions to conduct co-working sprints or writers workshops.\nThis section contains methods for adopting an Open Science broken up into specific goals, including: Creating a Lab Manual, Developing a Github Organization, and creating a Research Compendium.\nIn the spirit of collaborative open science, if you have an idea or suggestion for expanding or improving this set of Open Science materials, please follow the instructions below to submit and issue.",

To start, we recommend identifying the content you would like to put in there, and identify the Point of Contact (POC). As an example, we may put the following text:\nPOC: Jane Doe.

    "text": "Writers Workshop is a weekly co-working meeting where we work on our individual projects together. It is especially difficult to stay focused while writing, and these workshops provide a level of accountability that helps us move our writing forward.\nMeetings are virtual and typically 2-3 hours in length. You should have your materials ready before the workshop begins, so you can focus on your writing.",
