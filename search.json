As an example, we will change the “/content/Hardware.qmd” file. First, read the information in the page to understand the intended content. To start, we will organize different subheadings within this page.\nIdentify Sub-Headings. In this example, we will want to identify different types of Hardware used by our particular lab. In this example, we will want the following categories: “PAM Gliders”, “Drifting Recorders”, “Towed Arrays”, and “Handheld Hydrophones”.\n\nUsing the Source editor, use # to indicate Heading 1 style, ## for Heading 2 Style, etc.\nUsing the Visual editor, use the dropdown menu to select the Heading Style\n\nAdd Content using either the Source or Visual editor in RStudio. Most content will consist of text, with some images, hyperlinks, and occasional tables. To start, we recommend identifying the content you would like to put in there, and identify the Point of Contact (POC). As an example, we may put the following text:\nPOC: Jane Doe. General description of Hardware, links to online content (vendor specification page, relevant online content), instructions for build or maintain hardware (or links to that information), links to inventory, etc.\nOnce your outline is developed, fill in the content. IF someone else will collate the content– they can create it in a separate document to be copied/pasted here, or they can directly modify this page.\nIf you find you need separate pages for each sub-heading (instead of one long subheading), then create New Content, and link the new content to the _quarto.yml.",

For example, NOAA Fisheries has a single nmfs-ost Github Org.\nGithub Teams: Github Teams are groups of users of common projects, and there can also be teams within teams. For example: the PAM Strategic Initiative Team has a number of additional teams within it (one for each PAM-SI Team).\nA team belongs to an organization, and an organization can have many teams. Best practices suggest minimizing the number of existing Github Organizations, deferring to ‘Teams’ for identifying groups within an Organization.\nIn this exercise, each PAM-SI Team will develop a strategy for their Github team and develop a “Lab Manual” repository to serve as the ‘landing page’ for their team. Throughout, we will use the PAM-Glider team as an example. For reference, here is a link to the nmfs-ost Organization Standard Operating Procedures.",

If this team is within the nmfs-ost Organization, you may need to reach out to the Org Administrators to modify team members’ administrative rights. You can submit an Issue here to request assistance from the nmsf-ost administrators.\nCreate a Team Manual. This will serve as the primary go-to for all components of that team.\n\nFollow the methods for creating a ‘Lab Manual’ for your team (a ‘Team Manual’). Use the same naming structure for your team manual as your name. For example, the repository for the PAM-Glider team will be titled “PAM-Glider”.\nReadMe: Include an “About” statement to make it clear what this repository is.\nIndex.qmd: Create a home page that summarizes the goals and tasks of the teams. For suggestions, we recommend viewing the PAM-SI pages from the National PAM Network site and the PAM-Glider site.\nCreate a page for each component of your research (see PAM-Glider site as an example). Provide any methods, figures, preliminary results, or other summary information that might be useful to the public or to our NOAA administrators and managers.\nAdd a ‘contact us’ Page. Your team can decide the best way to receive contacts (email or submission of an issue related to the repository). If you ask them to submit an issue, create an issue templatethat automatically identifies the Assignees for that issue (and ensure that those Assignees will automatically receive an email for that issue).\n\nAlign Team Manual with PAM_National_Network\n\nReview the PAM-SI Page for your Team. Identify inconsistencies, updates, and helpful figures.\nCreate an Issue for that page by selecting the “Report an Issue” button on the upper right-hand side of the relevant page.

    "text": "Transfer existing repositories\nFor instructional purposes, we will refer to the original repository as the OldRepo and the New Repository (within the nmfs-ost org) as the NewRepo. If your previous repository was located within a different organization (say your science center org), we will refer to that as the OldOrg, and as the nmfs-ost as the NewOrg. For additional information, see the nmfs-ost SOP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO PII/BII are allowed on Github!! This includes confidential fisheries data, passwords, etc!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify Team Members. Ensure that all relevant NOAA personnel are listed as team members on the new organization (nmfs-ost). If there are non-NOAA partners who require administrative access to the repository, you will need to use alternative methods for outside collaboration (see Outside Collaborators, below). If this is unacceptable, then you may wait on transferring the repository, but still link to that repository from your Team Manual.\nPrepare Project Boards. Do you have any project boards linked to this repository? Project boards do not transfer; however, if you ensure that all Project Board entries are saved as ‘Issues’, then the Issues will transfer over and you can rebuild your Project Board in the new org (note that they will not retain their ‘status’ tags, so you may want to include a comment stating their status prior to transferring the repository). Closed issues may not transfer using this method and you may want to consider manually entering closed issues that should be retained.\nTransfer Repository. Navigate to the Settings of your OldOrg, and scroll down to the ‘Danger Zone’. Select the Transfer button to transfer the repository, and select the nmfs-ost Organization. Rename your Repository to include the prefix ‘PAM’ as part of the name (to facilitate searching).\nIdentify Admin Settings. Open the NewRepo in the nmfs-ost Enterprise organization. Can you see the settings? If not, you may not have admin rights. Submit an Issue here to request assistance from the nmsf-ost administrators to provide you with administrative rights for that repository.\nFix Github Pages. If your OldRepo had GithubPages (a website), check the Settings –&gt; Github Pages to ensure that GithubPages is turned ‘on’. If you have links to the Github Pages in your Readme or on the right sidebar, update those links. Update links in any other important locations. If you suspect the broken link from your previous OldRepo will be problematic, you can create a redirect from your old Organization by following the methods outlined in the nmfs-ost SOP ‘Auto-redirect Github Pages’.\nAdd an “About” Statement. Open the ReadMe and provide an “About” statement to make it clear what the purpose of the repository is.\nAdd NOAA Disclaimer and License. Revise readme to ensure that there is a NOAA Disclaimer (below) and a License file for software (including R packages){target=“_blank”}.\nSuggested Disclaimer:\n“This repository is a scientific product and is not official communication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the United States Department of Commerce. All NOAA GitHub project code is provided on an ‘as is’ basis and the user assumes responsibility for its use. Any claims against the Department of Commerce or Department of Commerce bureaus stemming from the use of this GitHub project will be governed by all applicable Federal law.

The Department of Commerce seal and logo, or the seal and logo of a DOC bureau, shall not be used in any manner to imply endorsement of any commercial product or activity by DOC or the United States Government.”\n\n\nAdd new repositories\nAs the work of your PAM-SI team expands, add additional repositories as needed. These teams are intended as cross-office or National level projects.\n\nIdentify active Repo Users. Will all active Repo Users have noaa emails? Will they have access to nmfs-ost? If not, then you can choose to either (1) host those repositories outside of the Enterprise Github nmfs-ost organization, or (2) require non-noaa users to submit push requests as a means of interacting with the repository. We have not yet tested this system to identify any problems.\nCreate Repository. Create your repository (see Quickstart for repositories) and use a thoughtful name that includes the Prefix ‘PAM’ (at a minimum). Use the word ‘test’ in the name if the purpose of this repo is to test something out (and later delete!). Consider using a template for your repo, such as our Research Compendium or our Lab Manual templates.\nAdd Team Members and ensure they have the appropriate level of user access.\nAdd an “About” Statement. Open the ReadMe and provide an “About” statement to make it clear what the purpose of the repository is.\nAdd NOAA Disclaimer and License. Revise the ReadMe to ensure that there is a NOAA Disclaimer (below) and a License file for software (including R packages) .\nSuggested Disclaimer:\n“This repository is a scientific product and is not official communication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the United States Department of Commerce.

The open sharing of knowledge not only helps our future selves, it also helps serves to lessen the inequities inherent in scientific research. When we learn something new, we should consider how we can share this information. Here we give advice on sharing knowledge through BioAcoustics Stack Exchange (a public Q & A platform) and with Zotero Libraries (shared public libraries to identify reports and publications).\nCo-working allows researchers to work together in time and/or space to provide motivation, accountability, and assistance. There are any number of ways to co-work, and here we provide a few suggestions to conduct co-working sprints or writers workshops.\nThis section contains methods for adopting an Open Science broken up into specific goals, including: Creating a Lab Manual, Developing a Github Organization, and creating a Research Compendium.\nIn the spirit of collaborative open science, if you have an idea or suggestion for expanding or improving this set of Open Science materials, please follow the instructions below to submit and issue.",
